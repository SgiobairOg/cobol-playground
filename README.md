#COBOL Playground
*I keep hearing there's a need for COBOL programmers in the world. Who am I to argue?*
##Setup
I've used Homebrew to setup COBOL on my Mac but, for an alternate method check out [TJWebb](https://github.com/tjwebb/learning-cobol) for the method he used. 
The brew method is as follows (you need XCode Command Line tools):
[ ]Start the xcode command line tools install with `xcode-select --install`
[ ]Once the xcode install is done install gnuCobol (formerly Open COBOL) with
`brew gnu-cobol`
