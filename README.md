# COBOL Playground
*I keep hearing there's a need for COBOL programmers in the world. Who am I to argue?*

## Setup
I originally used Homebrew to setup COBOL on my Mac however gnuCobol on Homebrew is currently out of date and I've been having some issues running my code. Instead, I'd recommend checking out [TJWebb](https://github.com/tjwebb/learning-cobol) for the method he used.
